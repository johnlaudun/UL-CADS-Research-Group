      "['\\ufeffMatt Walsh', 'Matt Walsh is an American conservative political commentator, author, and media host, born on June 18, 1986. He is best known for hosting \"The Matt Walsh Show,\" a podcast produced by The Daily Wire, where he discusses various political and cultural topics from a conservative perspective', '11/12/2024 (https://www.facebook.com/share/p/12HyBPz5vYQ/)', 'To any leftist contemplating cutting off family members for the unforgivable crime of having minds and opinions of their own: Sure, go ahead. But when you’re posting some tearful, self-pitying video in a few years about how lonely and sad you are, please don’t expect a shred of sympathy from the rest of us. You’re choosing isolation. You’re willingly disowning the only people who care about you unconditionally.', 'Because here’s the thing: the rest of us don’t want to be around you, don’t want to talk to you, and frankly don’t even want to know you. Why? Because you’re insufferable, perpetually offended, and a nightmare to be around. But your family? They love you anyway. They’re the only ones who will still care about you even when you’re being impossible. Push them away, and you’ll be left with no one. You’ll be alienated, miserable, and isolated from the only people who ever truly cared about you. And let’s be clear—you’ll deserve it.', 'But hey, you’ll have made a bold statement about Trump, one that will make no difference to the world. All it will do is add a little more misery to your own life. But that’s the choice you’re making.', '11/12/2024 (https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1B4NvNVhVd/)', 'Now that the GOP has officially secured control of the House, Republicans will have full control over Washington come January when President-elect Trump returns to the White House. Speaker Mike Johnson will be at the helm of this GOP-led House, and for the first time in years, Republicans control the House, Senate, and presidency. So, yes—rejoice. This is a win. But with that win comes responsibility, and the clock is ticking.', 'Now, if you’re a Republican in Congress or advising Trump, consider this your two-year warning. You have two years—at most—to prove you can actually deliver on your promises. There’s no excuse this time; Democrats are out of the way. Conservatives have been handed a rare window, and we’d be naive to assume it’ll stay open beyond two years. Historically, power swings back in the midterms, and if the GOP doesn’t take swift action, that window could slam shut faster than you can say “2026.” So this is it: the time to move on every part of the agenda conservatives have been talking about for decades.', 'And, no, we’re not here to “be patient.” I don’t want to hear any calls for “measured steps” or “moderate compromises.” We’ve heard all that nonsense before, and it got us nowhere. In 2016, we were told to trust the process. Well, Republicans had control then, too, and what did they achieve? A few tax cuts. That’s it. It was a wasted opportunity. We cannot afford another one. They need to start stacking up wins from day one. Being in the driver’s seat means showing us results. Winning is fantastic, but it only means something if you can make use of it.']\n"
